Complete this tree of tasks: markdown-todo-extractor-i6y (bd dep tree markdown-todo-extractor-i6y --direction down). Execute each task, one at a time, starting with the children and working your way up. For each task, assign yourself, set it in progress, and do the implementation. When done with a task, unassign yourself, mark it complete and commit your changes. Then move on to the next task. You are complete when there are no tasks left in the tree (bd dep tree markdown-todo-extractor-i6y --direction down)
