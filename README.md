## Usage

### Basic Usage

```

Extract all tasks from a directory (recursive):
```bash
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault
```

### Filtering Options

Filter by status:
```bash
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --status incomplete
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --status completed
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --status cancelled
```

Filter by due date:
```bash
# Tasks due on a specific date
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --due-on 2025-12-10

# Tasks due before a date
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --due-before 2025-12-31

# Tasks due after a date
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --due-after 2025-12-01
```

Filter by completed date:
```bash
# Tasks completed on a specific date
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --completed-on 2025-12-01

# Tasks completed before a date
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --completed-before 2025-12-31

# Tasks completed after a date
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --completed-after 2025-12-01
```

Filter by tags:
```bash
# Tasks with specific tags (must have all specified tags)
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --tags work,urgent

# Exclude tasks with certain tags
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault --exclude-tags archive,done
```

### Combining Filters

You can combine multiple filters:
```bash
markdown-todo-extractor path/to/vault \
  --status incomplete \
  --tags work \
  --due-before 2025-12-31
```

## Output Format

The tool outputs JSON with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "content": "Task description",
    "status": "incomplete",
    "file_path": "path/to/file.md",
    "file_name": "file.md",
    "line_number": 5,
    "raw_line": "- [ ] Task description #tag 📅 2025-12-10",
    "tags": ["tag"],
    "sub_items": ["Sub-item 1", "Sub-item 2"],
    "summary": null,
    "due_date": "2025-12-10",
    "priority": "high",
    "created_date": null,
    "completed_date": null
  }
]
```

## Example

Given a markdown file:

```markdown
# My Tasks

- [ ] Buy groceries #shopping 📅 2025-12-10
- [ ] Write report #work 🔼 due: 2025-12-15
  - Research topic
  - Outline structure
- [x] Finish project #work ✅ 2025-12-01
```

Running:
```bash
markdown-todo-extractor file.md --status incomplete --tags work
```

Will output only the "Write report" task with its sub-items.
